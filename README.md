As a user, I want to be able to create an appointment in my calendar from the web application and the mobile application so that I can keep track of my appointments from the web application and the mobile application.

As a user, I want to be able to search my appointments with a keyword so that I can find an appointment easily.

As a user, I want to be able to create recurring appointments so that I do not have to create many repeating appointments manually.

As a user, I want to be able to get notified on my phone when an appointment time is approaching so that I do not miss my appointments.
